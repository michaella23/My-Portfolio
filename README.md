# My Portfolio

## Objective

I wanted to create a visually appealing web page to introduce myself and a few of the projects I have worked on. I wanted to use a mobile-first approach to ensure that the user can easily navigate the page whether on their phone, tablet or computer.

## My Stack

I mostly used HTML and CSS for this project. The design is my own. I incorporated CSS flexbox and grid for the layout, and added a few subtle animations for the hover states.

## Accomplishments

I tried to focus on incorporating accessiblity in this project with semantic HTML, appropriate color contrast, hover/focus states for interactive elements, alt text for images and icons, and so on. I am still learning about accessibility and as I add to this portfolio I will make sure that is still a major focus in my work.

## Challenges

The hamburger menu tends to be a challenge for me, so this was good practice. I want to build more projects with `<nav>` elements, so I can continue to practice the skills I learned in this project.
